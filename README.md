# ETC5543-Bed-Forecasting
ETC5543 - Bed forecasting project

Geographical stroke units offer effective treatment for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke patients. Optimal care is achieved when patients are allocated to these wards. Determining the optimal number of beds required is a complex task.

The key goal of this project was to construct a discrete event simulation model, a digital replica, that captures the complexities and details of the stroke ward at Monash Hospital. Through this, we intended to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanics of the ward, including patient inflow, bed utilization, and patient waiting times.
