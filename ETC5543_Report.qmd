### ***Abstract***:

#### **Introduction**:

Geographical stroke units offer effective treatment for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke patients. Optimal care is achieved when patients are allocated to these wards. Determining the optimal number of beds required is a complex task. This study/project leverages discrete-event simulation, grounded in queueing theory, to ascertain the ideal number of beds for optimal care given patient influx. The study utilized stroke unit data including arrival rates, bed occupation times, and stroke severity probabilities to generate realistic scenarios for the simulation model. The objective of this project was to evaluate the impact of varying bed capacities on the performance of stroke care units such as bed utilization, maximum queue length, proportion of patients waiting, and average queue length.

#### **Method and Design**:

The simulation model considered factors such as patient arrival rates, stroke severity probabilities, and bed occupation times. Patient arrival rates were estimated to be 6 patients/day, based on an annual patient load of \~2000. The distribution of stroke severity was as follows: very mild (probability = 0.2), mild (probability = 0.2), moderate (probability = 0.35), severe (probability = 0.1), and very severe (probability = 0.15). Bed occupation times ranged from 1 day (very mild) to 3-21 days (severe). The study explored 25-50 bed scenarios and considered an increase in patient arrival to 2500 in the near future. Simulation was run for 100 replications, evaluating performance measures (e.g., average queue length, maximum queue length, and capacity utilization) with an initial 25-bed provision.

#### **Discussion:**

The study utilized stroke unit data, including arrival rates, bed occupation times, and stroke severity probabilities, to generate realistic scenarios for the simulation model. A simulation model showed that the initial 25-bed provision was inadequate for the annual patient load of \~2000, leading to prolonged wait times and queues. The percent of patients queuing was around \~ 33% for 25 beds, 23% for 30 beds, and 5% for 40 beds.

### ***Background and Motivation***

**Introduction to hospital capacity planning**

Healthcare systems worldwide are under continual pressure to provide accessible and effective health services to patients; consequently, the decision-making regarding the adequate provision of services to the patients is crucial for optimal patient care in hospitals. Hence, hospital capacity planning has emerged as a critical issue due to the increasing demand for hospital care and rising costs of inpatient care. Key metrics, such as bed capacity and associated indices such as bed occupancy and the ratio of beds to population are used to determine the availability of inpatient care [@Ravaghi2020]. The number of beds in a hospital can be considered a capital stock, influenced by the performance of medical staff and equipment [@healthGlance2017] [@liu2012] .

A shortage of available beds is the primary cause of delays in emergency admission and surgery cancellations, and premature patient discharge [@rechel2010hospital]. Conversely, underutilization of beds in the hospitals leads to additional hospital costs.

According to Storey et al. (2010) in their article "Hospital capacity planning: From measuring stocks to modelling flows" published in the Medical Journal of Australia, an 85% bed occupancy rate is a reasonable target for hospitals. However, this target may need adjustment depending on the facility and time periods @martin_storey_2010. Effective hospital resource management, including bed capacity, requires short- and long-term hospital capacity planning.

**Simulation-based Modeling in Healthcare Policy**

To develop better policy frameworks for healthcare industry, researchers, policy makers and other professionals studying the healthcare systems have employed simulation-based modeling to replicate the real life scenarios in the healthcare units and hospitals to improve the policy framework.

**The Monash Hospital Stroke Ward Case**

Stroke is ranked as the second leading cause of death with an annual mortality rate of over 6.5 million worldwide and 143.23 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2019 according to the *Global stroke fact sheet* released by the [World Stroke Organization](https://www.world-stroke.org/news-and-blog/news/wso-global-stroke-fact-sheet-2022). In Australia in 2018, an estimated 387,000 Australians aged 15 and over (1.3% of the population) had experienced a stroke at *some point* in their lives, based on self-reported data from the [ABS Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers (ABS 2019)](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/heart-stroke-vascular-diseases/hsvd-facts/contents/heart-stroke-and-vascular-disease-subtypes/stroke). As per the same soruce, in 2020, there were an estimated **39,500 stroke events** in Australia--- more than 100 everyday. The rate of stroke events was 154 per 100,000 population. These stroke events include the new and recurrent stroke.[^1] In 2020, stroke was recorded as the underlying cause of 8,200 deaths, accounting for 5.1% of all deaths in Australia. Stroke was one of the 5 leading causes of death in Australia -- on average, 22 Australians died of stroke each day in 2020.[^2]

[^1]: There are no direct national data sources on the annual number of strokes. However, a related measure can be used as an estimate---the number of stroke events---developed by the AIHW using unlinked hospital and deaths data (AIHW 2022)

[^2]: These figures were obtained from the [Australian Institute of Health & Welfare (AIHW)](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/heart-stroke-vascular-diseases/hsvd-facts/contents/summary-of-coronary-heart-disease-and-stroke/stroke)

Since 1980 the death rates for stroke have fallen by three-quarters -- from *110 to 23* per **100,000** population for males, and from *99 to 24* per **100,000** population for females. Access to stroke care units has been attributed to as one of the leading factors for declining death rates in Australia[^3].

While, according to the *Victorian Population Health Survey* (2016) [^4], the prevalence of stroke among the adult Victorian population was 2.7% of the adult population.

In the stroke ward at the Monash Hospital there are a total of 46 beds as used by the neurology, neurosurgery and stroke patients. The objective of this project was to determine the optimal number of beds specifically for the stroke patients at the Monash Hospital to ensure the optimum care for the stroke patients.

For the purpose of this project at the *Monash Medical Research institute*, I have used the simulation modelling to represent a queuing system within a hospital setting. The main objective of this simulation was to simulate the flow of patients as they arrive, wait in line (queue) for an available bed, receive treatment, and exit the resource (making the bed available for the next patient in the queue to use).
