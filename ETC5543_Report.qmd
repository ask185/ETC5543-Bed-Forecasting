### ***Abstract***:

#### **Introduction**:

Geographical stroke units offer effective treatment for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke patients. Optimal care is achieved when patients are allocated to these wards. Determining the optimal number of beds required is a complex task. This study/project leverages discrete-event simulation, grounded in queueing theory, to ascertain the ideal number of beds for optimal care given patient influx. The study utilized stroke unit data including arrival rates, bed occupation times, and stroke severity probabilities to generate realistic scenarios for the simulation model. The objective of this project was to evaluate the impact of varying bed capacities on the performance of stroke care units such as bed utilization, maximum queue length, proportion of patients waiting, and average queue length.

#### **Method and Design**:

The simulation model considered factors such as patient arrival rates, stroke severity probabilities, and bed occupation times. Patient arrival rates were estimated to be 6 patients/day, based on an annual patient load of \~2000. The distribution of stroke severity was as follows: very mild (probability = 0.2), mild (probability = 0.2), moderate (probability = 0.35), severe (probability = 0.1), and very severe (probability = 0.15). Bed occupation times ranged from 1 day (very mild) to 3-21 days (severe). The study explored 25-50 bed scenarios and considered an increase in patient arrival to 2500 in the near future. Simulation was run for 100 replications, evaluating performance measures (e.g., average queue length, maximum queue length, and capacity utilization) with an initial 25-bed provision.

#### **Discussion:**

The study utilized stroke unit data, including arrival rates, bed occupation times, and stroke severity probabilities, to generate realistic scenarios for the simulation model. A simulation model showed that the initial 25-bed provision was inadequate for the annual patient load of \~2000, leading to prolonged wait times and queues. The percent of patients queuing was around \~ 33% for 25 beds, 23% for 30 beds, and 5% for 40 beds.

### ***Background and Motivation***

**Introduction to hospital capacity planning**

Healthcare systems worldwide are under continual pressure to provide accessible and effective health services to patients; consequently, the decision-making regarding the adequate provision of services to the patients is crucial for optimal patient care in hospitals. Hence, hospital capacity planning has emerged as a critical issue due to the increasing demand for hospital care and rising costs of inpatient care. Key metrics, such as bed capacity and associated indices such as bed occupancy and the ratio of beds to population are used to determine the availability of inpatient care [@Ravaghi2020]. The number of beds in a hospital can be considered a capital stock, influenced by the performance of medical staff and equipment [@healthGlance2017] [@liu2012] .

A shortage of available beds is the primary cause of delays in emergency admission and surgery cancellations, and premature patient discharge [@rechel2010hospital]. Conversely, underutilization of beds in the hospitals leads to additional hospital costs.

According to Storey et al. (2010) in their article "Hospital capacity planning: From measuring stocks to modelling flows" published in the Medical Journal of Australia, an 85% bed occupancy rate is a reasonable target for hospitals. However, this target may need adjustment depending on the facility and time periods @martin_storey_2010. Effective hospital resource management, including bed capacity, requires short- and long-term hospital capacity planning.

Simulation-based Modeling in Healthcare Policy

To develop better policy frameworks for healthcare industry, researchers, policy makers and other professionals studying the healthcare systems have employed simulation-based modeling to replicate the real life scenarios in the healthcare units and hospitals to improve the policy framework. For the purpose of this project at the *Monash Medical Research institute*, I have used the simulation modelling to represent a queuing system within a hospital setting. The main objective of this simulation was to simulate the flow of patients as they arrive, wait in line (queue) for an available bed, receive treatment, and exit the resource (making the bed available for the next patient in the queue to use).

In the stroke ward at the Monash Hospital there are a total of 46 beds as used by the neurology, neurosurgery and stroke patients. The objective of this project was to determine the optimal number of beds specifically for the stroke patients at the Monash Hospital to ensure the optimum care for the stroke patients.
