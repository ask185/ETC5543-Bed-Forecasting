# <span> Background </span>

<br>

Key Insights - <span> *Economic Impact of Stroke*</span> (Deloitte Australia - 2020)

<br> 

 <span>445,087</span> individuals were grappling with the aftermath of a Stroke.

 
 Stroke was the cause of death for <span>8,703</span>

 A stroke incident occurred every  <span>19 minutes </span>

 
 Estimated <span>27,428</span> people encountered a stroke for the first time in their lives

##



 Geographical stroke unit care is a <span>**proven stroke therapy**</span> for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke patients.
 
 <br>
 
 Optimal care is achieved when patients are <span>**allocated to these wards**</span>. 
 
 <br>
 
<span> **Access to stroke care units** </span> has been attributed to as one of the leading factors for declining death rates    in Australia among stroke patients.
 
 <br>
 
<span> **Estimating the optimal number of beds** </span> in a stroke unit is a critical and challenging task




# <span> Objectives </span>

*Discrete Event Simulation* > *Performance metrics* > *shiny-web-app*



![](discreteEvent.png)



# <span> Method </span>

(*Stepts I took to set up a model*)


<span>**Identified the Key Input Parameters**</span>: arrival rate, total number of patients, stroke level probabilities, bed occupation time 

<br>

<span>**Defined auxiliary functions**</span>: assign stroke categories, generates the inter-arrival times & length of stay 

<br>

<span>**Defined the main stroke function**</span>: updates length of stay, tracks queue length and assigns avaiable beds

<br>

<span>**Ran multiple simulations**</span>: we ran <span>2000</span> simulations

## 

<span>**Computed performance metrics**</span>: *percent of patients waiting*, *utilization percentage* & *max. queue length*.

# <span>Results</span>

<span> **Key Performance Metrics** </span>

<br>

Percent of Patients waiting (<span> 5% threshold </span>)

<br>

Maximum Queue Length (<span> < 5% threshold </span>)

<br>

Utilization Percentage (<span> context dependent </span>)

# <span> Conclusion </span> 


<span>Captures</span> the intricate interplay between different individual components of the System. 

<br>

<span>Effectively </span> assesses the impact of bed availability on patient outcomes. 

<br>

<span>Enhances</span> resource allocation, <span>minimizing</span> patient wait times, and <span>optimizing</span> bed utilization.

<br>

 <span> **Limitations** </span> 

<span>Assumptions</span> on patient arrivals, stroke severity, and bed occupancy.
