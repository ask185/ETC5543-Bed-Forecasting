# <span> Simulation </span> {background-image="joel-filipe-Mbf3xFiC1Zo-unsplash.jpg" background-size="cover"}
<span>*Method and structure of the Model*</span>

##

<span> We simulated the model for an annual load of $350$ patients at Monash health. </span>

![](Stroke_CatTable_sim.png){style='width:100%; height:100%; object-fit:cover'}

##

### <span> Arrivals Data </span>

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}

![](arrivalData.png){style='width:100%; height:100%; object-fit:cover'}

:::

::: {.column width="30%"}


<span> Here you can see the first six rows of the Patient arrivals data. </span> 

<span><br></span>

<span> The auxiliary functions, I created, computed the patients inter-arrival times, assigned stroke categories based on the stroke level probabilities to patients, and calculated the length of stay of the patients based on the assigned stroke categories.

### <span> Distribution of Patients </span>

::: columns

::: {.column width="80%"}

![](DistOfPatients_inEachStrokeCat.png){style='width:80%; height:100%; object-fit:cover'}
:::

::: {.column width="20%"}

<span> Here we see that $137$ patients were assigned the *mild* category of stroke. These assignments of the category are based on the probabilities of stroke levels. </span>

## {auto-animate=true}

### <span>Mean Length of stay </span>

::: {.column width="80%"}

![](Mean_lenghtOfStay_byStrokeCat.png){style='width:80%; height:100%; object-fit:cover'}

<span> In this figure we can observe the mean length of stay of patients from each category of stroke in the arrivals data. </span>

# <span>Results</span> {background-image="national-cancer-institute-ct10qdGv1hQ-unsplash.jpg"}

<span> We used the performance metrics such as the percent of patients waiting, utilization percentages and the maximum queue length to make the assessment about the optimal number of beds required in  the ward. </span>

## {auto-animate=true}

<span> I ran the simulation for 2000 times for 25 different number of beds (from 5 − 30) for 350
patients ( run_simulation function ran a total of 2000 × 25 = 50000 times, each time with
the different combination of simulation number and number of beds).</span>

## {auto-animate=true}

<span> The two key metrics studied for this project were the *percent of patients waiting* and the *utilization rates*.

<span> I ran the simulation for 2000 times for 25 different number of beds (from 5 − 30) for 350
patients ( run_simulation function ran a total of 2000 × 25 = 50000 times, each time with
the different combination of simulation number and number of beds).</span>

## {auto-animate=true}

<span> As explained by Prof. Phan, ideally the hospital would
desire to have less than 5% of the patients waiting (queuing) to be admitted into the stroke
ward at any given time. </span>

## {auto-animate=true}

<span>This is an [important threshold]{.fragment .highlight-red} considered when determining the optimal number of beds in the stroke ward.</span>

## {auto-animate=true}

### <span>Key Metrics</span> 

![](keyMetricTab.png){style='width:80%; height:100%'}

## {auto-animate=true}

### <span>Percent of Patients Waiting</span>

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
![](percentPWaiting.png)
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}

::: {.incremental}

<span> This 5% rule for the percent of patients waiting, is an *average or overall target* for the year. </span>

<span><br></span>

<span>The Figure shows that the optimal number of beds for a stroke ward with 350 patients annually would be 10 beds. </span>

:::

:::

## {auto-animate=true}

### <span>Maximum Queue length</span>

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}

![](MaxQueueLength.png){style='object-fit:cover'}
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}

::: {.incremental}

<span> For 350 patients annually \& 11 beds in the ward, a maximum queue length of 15 means that at the peak of demand during the year, there were 15 patients waiting to be admitted. </span>

<span><br></span>

<span> However, it is important to be noted that this doesn’t mean that 15 patients will be waiting at all times. </span>

:::

##

### <span>Utilization Percentage</span>

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}

![](UtilizationPercent.png){style='width:80%; height:90%; object-fit:cover'}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}


<span> Utilization percentages at 11 beds for 350 patients annually is less than
70%. Typically 0.80(80\%) is considered an optimal utilization rate for wards.</span>

<br>

<span>[However, this figure can vary greatly depending on context!]{.fragment .highlight-red}</span>

<br>

<span> Some patients may need to stay for longer periods to recover, Thus, it becomes critically important to ensure that there are enough beds available to accommodate patient influxes.</span>

## <span> Sensitivity Analysis </span>

![](sensitivityAnalysis.png){style='width:80%; height:90%; object-fit:cover'}

## {auto-animate=true}

<span>The variables tested include arrival_rate,
bed_occupation_time, stroke_level_prob, and total_patients, with each variable multiplied
by a factor of 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, and 4.5, respectively.</span>

<span>On the other hand, changes in stroke_level_prob, representing the proportion of stroke severity levels, did not have a significant impact on the healthcare system performance. </span>

<br>

<span>Similar trends were observed with bed_occupation_time.</span>

<br>

<span>For the arrival_rate, as the multiplying factor increased, we observed a consistent rise in utilization, percent_patients_waiting, and max_queue_length. With a 1.5 multiplier, the
mean utilization was 0.7581, increasing steadily to 0.9783 at a 4.5 multiplier. </span>

## {auto-animate=true}

<span>Lastly, changes in total_patients exhibited similar trends to arrival_rate and bed_occupation_time,with all measured values increasing alongside the multiplier. </span>

## {auto-animate=true}

<span> However, these changes were more drastic, indicating that an increase in the total number of patients significantly strains the healthcare system.</span>

## {auto-animate=true}

<span>In conclusion, these findings illustrate the healthcare system’s vulnerability to high patient arrival rates, extended bed occupation times, and a large total number of patients.</span> 

<br>

<span> However, these changes were more drastic, indicating that an increase in the total number of patients significantly strains the healthcare system.</span>

## {auto-animate=true}

<span> While
stroke severity level changes do not significantly affect system performance, strategic improvements should focus on efficient patient handling and reducing bed occupation times to enhance capacity and minimize patient waiting times. </span>

# <span> Conclusion </span> {background-image="brano-Mm1VIPqd0OA-unsplash.jpg" background-size="cover"}

## {auto-animate=true}

<span>Remarkably, it was observed that the intricate interplay between
the count of hospital beds, yearly patient influx, and bed occupancy durations results in
substantial effects on both patient wait times and bed utilization ratios.</span>

## {auto-animate=true}

<span>The ability of our model to imitate various availability
of hospital beds was instrumental in evaluating their impact on percent of patients waiting and

### <span> Limitations </span> 

<span> Despite its advantages, our model has its inherent limitations. It oversimplifies a complex reality, based on assumptions about patient arrival times, stroke severity distributions, and bed occupancy durations. The actual situation may stray from these assumptions.</span>

## {auto-animate=true}

<span> Also, the model overlooks other potential chokepoints in stroke patient
care, like the availability of healthcare staff or medical apparatus.</span>

### <span>Future Enhancements </span>

<span>Future enhancements to this model could include its extension to a broader healthcare simulation, assimilating other elements of hospital resources and facilities. </span>

<br>

<span> Including dynamic variables such as time-dependent arrival rates and fluctuating stroke severity levels could provide a more accurate representation of hospital operations.</span>

## {auto-animate=true}

<span>Further, future iterations could investigate the integration of machine learning methodologies for predicting patient loads and stroke severity distributions, thereby enhancing the decision-making process.</span>
