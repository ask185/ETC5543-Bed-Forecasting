### Data simulation


Here I am not using any package to simulate the data.

```{r eval=T, echo=TRUE, message=F}

library(tidyverse)

total_patients <- 2000 # assuming there are 2000 all around the year
patients_per_month <- 2000/12 # patients per month
arrival_rate <- 6  # average 6 patients per day

# Bed occupation time (in days) for each stroke level

bed_occupation_time <- list(
  very_mild = 1,
  mild = c(3, 7),
  moderate = c(3,14),  # patients sent to rehab center may stay up to 2 weeks in the ward
  severe_nursing = c(3,21),  # patients sent to nursing center may stay up to 3 weeks
  severe = c(1,21) # die
)

# Probability of each stroke level
stroke_level_prob <- c(0.2, 0.2, 0.35, 0.1, 0.15)

# Number of beds in the stroke ward
num_beds <- 25

```

```{r}

# the function below is created to generate the inter-arrival times between the patients.
# the inter arrival follows an exponential distribution hence rexp(), arrival rate is
# defined above

generate_interarrival_times <- function(total_patients, arrival_rate) {
  interarrival_times <- rexp(total_patients, rate = arrival_rate)
  return(interarrival_times)
}

# the function is created to assign patients (from total_patients) randomly a stroke level.
# This assignment is based on the probabilities defined in the stroke_level_prob. 
# To achieve this we use sample()

assign_stroke_levels <- function(total_patients, stroke_level_prob) {

# wherein most patients would be assigned the severe stroke level category.

    # if the stroke level is 1 (very mild) then set the length of the stay == bed occupation
    # times of the patient with the level 1 stroke. This is done for every patient with level
    # 1 stroke

      length_of_stay[i] <- bed_occupation_time[[stroke_level]]
    } else {
      # else if the stroke level is not 1 
      # then set the length of stay of the patient equal to 
      # random number of days between the lower and upper bound of the days 
      # the patient with a certain level of severity would need to stay
      # in the ward
      # sample() is used here to take on random number of days
      # between the lower bound and upper bound of the days
      # [[1]] indicates the lower bound and [[2]] indicates the upper bound
      length_of_stay[i] <- sample(bed_occupation_time[[stroke_level]][1]:bed_occupation_time[[stroke_level]][2], 1)
